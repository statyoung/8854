#Explainable AI: GAM-Based Transparent Models & Post-hoc Methods

Overview
This repository contains implementations of GAM-based transparent models such as NAM (Neural Additive Models), NBM (Neural Basis Models), and EBM (Explainable Boosting Machine), along with post-hoc explanation techniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations).

The project explores the application of these models to various datasets, providing comparative experiments, visualizations, and interpretability analysis to demonstrate their effectiveness in Explainable AI (XAI).
