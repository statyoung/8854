# Explainable AI and Anormaly Detection

Overview

This repository contains two AI projects focused on:
1. Building Explainable models for high-stakes decisions using Explainable AI (XAI)  
2. Developing anomaly detection techniques under class imbalance.

These projects aim to develop models that are not only accurate but also interpretable and reliable enough to be deployed in real-world financial and fraud detection systems.

## Applications
These models can be applied to:
- Credit risk scoring
- Insurance claim screening
- Fraud detection in transactions
- Customer retention modeling
